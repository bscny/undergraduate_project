# DRONE FLIGHT LOG

## FLIGHT IDENTIFICATION

**Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Start Time:** 10:00  
**End Time:** 10:02  
**Total Duration:** 1 min 9 sec

## FLIGHT PURPOSE & OPERATIONS

**Purpose of Flight:** capture scenic visuals from a beautiful landscape  
**Type of Operation:** Recreational Flight

## LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT

**Location Name/Description:** China, ZhangJiajie - Sandstone pillar formations with mountain pavilion. A landscape featuring numerous large, steep, rocky, tree-covered floating or very tall mountains/cliffs, often shrouded in mist or clouds. A traditional Asian-style building with traditional tiled roof is visible on one of the islands.  
**GPS Coordinates (Takeoff):** open land from one of the mountain  
**GPS Coordinates (Landing):** same as takeoff place  
**Weather Conditions:**
- Wind Speed: Light winds (inferred from slow cloud drift), not visible on surface
- Wind Direction: Generally left-to-right across formations, not visible on surface
- Visibility: Excellent above cloud layer, hazy in valleys, with some areas obscured by mist/clouds between islands
- Temperature: Not mentioned/visible
- Cloud Cover: Dense cloud layer filling valleys between pillars; scattered clouds/mist around and between the floating islands; clear sky above
- Precipitation: None

## FLIGHT PARAMETERS

**Maximum Altitude:** High altitude above cloud layer (drone ascends significantly among tall rock formations)  
**Maximum Distance:** Not mentioned/visible (drone moves horizontally to reveal wider landscape)  
**Flight Pattern:** ☑ Free Flight ☑ Orbit (around pavilion)  
**Key Waypoints/Locations:** Mountain pavilion with traditional tiled roof, central sandstone spire, multiple rock pillar formations, floating islands, traditional building on an island  
**Flight Path Summary:** Complex flight beginning with a close-up, downward view of a single floating island, then ascending and rotating to reveal a vast panorama of multiple floating islands. The drone orbits around sandstone pillars and mountain pavilion, with frequent altitude changes and camera rolls/inversions for dramatic angles. Flight continues with orbiting and panning movements to showcase the expansive environment.

## CAMERA & RECORDING SETTINGS

**Video Resolution:** 1920x1080  
**Frame Rate:** 20.0 fps  
**Recording Format:** MP4

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**Obstacles Present:** ☑ Trees ☑ Buildings ☑ Other: Tall sandstone pillars, steep cliff faces, large rocky floating islands/mountains  
**People in Area:** ☑ None  
**Emergency Landing Sites:** Mountain pavilion terrace area, flat-topped rock formations (not all sites clearly visible)

## INCIDENTS & OBSERVATIONS

**Any Issues Encountered:** None reported/visible  
**Wildlife Interactions:** None observed/visible  
**Signal Loss Events:** None reported/visible  
**Weather Changes:** Gradual cloud movement and thinning throughout flight; no significant weather changes observed with consistent bright, sunny lighting above clouds  
**Equipment Malfunctions:** None reported/visible

## NOTES & LESSONS LEARNED

**Flight Performance:** Complex maneuvering with frequent camera inversions and dramatic banking angles; smooth and stable flight with good control  
**Footage Quality:** High quality with strong contrast between sunlit rock and shadowed areas, some overexposure in bright cloud centers; clear, well-exposed, and stable footage overall  
**Areas for Improvement:** Managing exposure in high-contrast conditions between bright clouds and rock formations  
**Future Considerations:** Traditional mountain pavilion provides excellent focal point for dramatic landscape cinematography; cloud layer creates ethereal atmosphere but requires careful exposure management. To further capture scenic visuals, consider exploring different flight paths to highlight unique geological features, varying times of day for diverse lighting effects, or focusing on specific architectural details of the building if the purpose expands to include cultural documentation.
