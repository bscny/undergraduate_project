**Total Duration:** 1 min 54 sec

## FLIGHT PURPOSE & OPERATIONS

**Purpose of Flight:** City Safety Monitoring  
**Type of Operation:** Aerial Surveillance

## LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT

**Location Name/Description:** Simulator city - Starts at the edge of a simulated city with open land and low-rise buildings, transitioning to a dense urban environment with downtown district featuring roundabouts, high-rise office buildings, grid street network, and green spaces  
**GPS Coordinates (Takeoff):** Open land in rural area  
**GPS Coordinates (Landing):** Other place (not visible in the video)  
**Weather Conditions:**
- Wind Speed: Calm (not visible)
- Wind Direction: N/A
- Visibility: Excellent - Clear, bright sunlight with sharp shadows
- Temperature: Not mentioned
- Cloud Cover: Clear/cloudless conditions
- Precipitation: None - dry conditions

## FLIGHT PARAMETERS

**Maximum Altitude:** Very high (above skyscrapers)  
**Maximum Distance:** Not mentioned  
**Flight Pattern:** ☑ Free Flight  
**Key Waypoints/Locations:** Starts over open land near low-rise buildings, moves over multiple intersections, roundabout with central fountain, curved connector roads, cylindrical glass tower, triangular rooftop building, grid of city streets with various commercial/residential buildings including some with rooftop solar panels  
**Flight Path Summary:** The drone performs a continuous upward and forward movement, starting from a low altitude over undeveloped land at the city's edge, gradually ascending and moving into the dense urban core. Systematic survey of downtown district moving between various intersections and vantage points, focusing on traffic monitoring at key junctions, providing a top-down, rotating view of the city's infrastructure, buildings, and traffic.

## CAMERA & RECORDING SETTINGS

**Video Resolution:** 1920x1080  
**Frame Rate:** 20.0 fps  
**Recording Format:** MP4

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**Obstacles Present:** ☑ Trees ☑ Buildings - Multiple high-rise office towers, mid-rise buildings ☑ Other: Roads with traffic  
**People in Area:** ☑ None - No pedestrians visible throughout flight  
**Emergency Landing Sites:** Open land at the start of the flight, open lots and plazas visible between buildings, various open spaces between buildings later in the flight

## INCIDENTS & OBSERVATIONS

**Any Issues Encountered:** None reported  
**Wildlife Interactions:** None observed  
**Signal Loss Events:** None reported  
**Weather Changes:** None - consistent clear, bright conditions throughout  
**Equipment Malfunctions:** None reported

## NOTES & LESSONS LEARNED

**Flight Performance:** Smooth operation with systematic coverage of multiple intersections and traffic monitoring points. Smooth and stable flight with continuous ascent and panoramic rotation, providing clear views of the city.  
**Footage Quality:** High quality, clear, and stable footage with good lighting. Clear, sharp imagery with good contrast - bright midday lighting provided excellent visibility of street markings, crosswalks, and vehicle movements  
**Areas for Improvement:** Not mentioned  
**Future Considerations:** Flight demonstrated effective traffic monitoring capabilities in urban environment with multiple complex intersections including roundabouts and multi-lane corridors. Given the purpose of City Safety Monitoring, future flights could focus on specific areas of interest, monitor traffic flow at key intersections, or assess infrastructure integrity. The current flight provides a good overview, but more detailed, lower-altitude passes might be beneficial for specific safety checks.
