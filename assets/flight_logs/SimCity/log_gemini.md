**Total Duration:** 1 min 54 sec

## FLIGHT PURPOSE & OPERATIONS

**Purpose of Flight:** City Safety Monitoring  
**Type of Operation:** Aerial Surveillance

## LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT

**Location Name/Description:** Simulator city. Starts at the edge of a simulated city with open land and low-rise buildings, transitioning to a dense urban environment with high-rise buildings, roads, and green spaces.  
**GPS Coordinates (Takeoff):** Open land in rural area  
**GPS Coordinates (Landing):** Other place (not visible in the video)  
**Weather Conditions:**
- Wind Speed: Calm (not visible)
- Wind Direction: N/A
- Visibility: Excellent
- Temperature: N/A
- Cloud Cover: Clear sky
- Precipitation: None

## FLIGHT PARAMETERS

**Maximum Altitude:** Very high (above skyscrapers)  
**Maximum Distance:** N/A  
**Flight Pattern:** ⬜ Hover ⬜ Linear ⬜ Orbit ⬜ Waypoint ☒ Free Flight  
**Key Waypoints/Locations:** Starts over open land near low-rise buildings, moves over a grid of city streets with various commercial/residential buildings, including some with rooftop solar panels, and concludes over a large roundabout.  
**Flight Path Summary:** The drone performs a continuous upward and forward movement, starting from a low altitude over undeveloped land at the city's edge, gradually ascending and moving into the dense urban core, providing a top-down, rotating view of the city's infrastructure, buildings, and traffic.

## CAMERA & RECORDING SETTINGS

**Video Resolution:** 1920x1080  
**Frame Rate:** 20.0 fps  
**Recording Format:** MP4  

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**Obstacles Present:** ⬜ None ☒ Trees ☒ Buildings ⬜ Power Lines ☒ Other: Roads with traffic  
**People in Area:** ⬜ None ⬜ Pilot Only ⬜ Small Group ⬜ Crowd  
**Emergency Landing Sites:** Open land at the start of the flight, various open spaces between buildings later in the flight.

## INCIDENTS & OBSERVATIONS

**Any Issues Encountered:** None  
**Wildlife Interactions:** None  
**Signal Loss Events:** None  
**Weather Changes:** None  
**Equipment Malfunctions:** None  

## NOTES & LESSONS LEARNED

**Flight Performance:** Smooth and stable flight with continuous ascent and panoramic rotation, providing clear views of the city.  
**Footage Quality:** High quality, clear, and stable footage with good lighting.  
**Areas for Improvement:** N/A  
**Future Considerations:** Given the purpose of City Safety Monitoring, future flights could focus on specific areas of interest, monitor traffic flow at key intersections, or assess infrastructure integrity. The current flight provides a good overview, but more detailed, lower-altitude passes might be beneficial for specific safety checks.
