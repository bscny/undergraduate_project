# DRONE FLIGHT LOG

## FLIGHT IDENTIFICATION

**Date:** 2025-08-20  
**Start Time:** 10:00  
**End Time:** 10:03  
**Total Duration:** 1 min 2 sec

## FLIGHT PURPOSE & OPERATIONS

**Purpose of Flight:** assessing the extent and layout of solar panel installations  
**Type of Operation:** Industrial Survey Flight

## LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT

**Location Name/Description:** America, rural industry area - Industrial complex with multiple large warehouses/factories featuring solar panel installations, adjacent to a multi-track railway line. The area includes large warehouse with dark roof, smaller auxiliary buildings, paved and unpaved yards with construction/storage materials, storage tanks, crane, and some sparse vegetation  
**GPS Coordinates (Takeoff):** open space next to the zone  
**GPS Coordinates (Landing):** same as takeoff place  
**Weather Conditions:**
- Wind Speed: Not visible (no discernible wind effects on vegetation or dust)
- Wind Direction: Not visible
- Visibility: Clear - bright lighting throughout
- Temperature: Not mentioned
- Cloud Cover: Clear sky with strong, defined shadows indicating direct sunlight (warm, golden late afternoon sunlight)
- Precipitation: None

## FLIGHT PARAMETERS

**Maximum Altitude:** Not precisely determinable, but appears to be at a consistent altitude providing an overhead view of the industrial complex  
**Maximum Distance:** Not precisely determinable  
**Flight Pattern:** ☑ Free Flight ⬜ Hover ⬜ Linear ⬜ Orbit ⬜ Waypoint  
**Key Waypoints/Locations:** Large warehouse with dark roof, long building with solar panels on roof, railway tracks, storage tanks, smaller auxiliary buildings, construction/storage yard, crane, various industrial structures and parking areas  
**Flight Path Summary:** The drone begins hovering over a large warehouse, then moves linearly along a long building featuring solar panels on its roof, while panning to reveal the adjacent railway lines and other parts of the industrial complex. Aerial survey flight over industrial complex with slight perspective changes and camera rotation to capture different angles of solar panel installations and comprehensive facility layout

## CAMERA & RECORDING SETTINGS

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**Obstacles Present:** ☑ Buildings ⬜ None ⬜ Trees ☑ Power Lines ☑ Other: Crane, storage tanks, railway tracks, railway infrastructure, parked vehicles  
**People in Area:** ⬜ None ☑ Pilot Only ⬜ Small Group ⬜ Crowd (No people clearly visible in the video, but parked cars suggest presence)  
**Emergency Landing Sites:** Open spaces with construction materials scattered around, open ground within the industrial complex, including parking areas  

## INCIDENTS & OBSERVATIONS

**Any Issues Encountered:** None visible  
**Wildlife Interactions:** None visible  
**Signal Loss Events:** None visible  
**Weather Changes:** None - consistent late afternoon lighting throughout, no changes observed during the flight  
**Equipment Malfunctions:** None visible  

## NOTES & LESSONS LEARNED

**Flight Performance:** Smooth and stable flight with consistent perspective changes for comprehensive facility documentation  
**Footage Quality:** High quality 4K footage with consistent lighting and clear detail of solar panel installations - high resolution, clear, well-exposed, and stable  
**Areas for Improvement:** N/A  
**Future Considerations:** Facility shows signs of ongoing construction/expansion activities with crane and scattered materials, suggesting potential for follow-up surveys
