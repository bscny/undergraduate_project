# DRONE FLIGHT LOG

## FLIGHT IDENTIFICATION

**Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Start Time:** 10:00  
**End Time:** 10:03  
**Total Duration:** 2 min 20 sec

## FLIGHT PURPOSE & OPERATIONS

**Purpose of Flight:** City Safety Monitoring  
**Type of Operation:** Aerial Surveillance

## LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT

**Location Name/Description:** Simulator city (starts over undeveloped land, transitions through suburban commercial/residential, then dense urban, and ends near a coastal residential area)  
**GPS Coordinates (Takeoff):** Open land in rural area  
**GPS Coordinates (Landing):** Other place (not visible in the video)  
**Weather Conditions:**
- Wind Speed: Appears calm (no visible wind effects on trees or water)
- Wind Direction: N/A
- Visibility: Excellent, clear
- Temperature: N/A
- Cloud Cover: Clear sky
- Precipitation: None

## FLIGHT PARAMETERS

**Maximum Altitude:** Not visible (continuously increasing, reaches high altitude over skyscrapers)  
**Maximum Distance:** Not visible (covers a significant area of the simulated city)  
**Flight Pattern:** ⬜ Hover ⬜ Linear ⬜ Orbit ☒ Free Flight  
**Key Waypoints/Locations:** Undeveloped land, commercial buildings, residential houses, downtown skyscrapers including some with rooftop solar panels, roundabout, coastal area/beach.  
**Flight Path Summary:** The drone begins over an open, undeveloped grassy area, then transitions over a suburban zone featuring commercial buildings and residential houses. It continues into a dense urban core with multiple high-rise buildings and a prominent roundabout. The flight concludes over a coastal residential area adjacent to a body of water and a beach. The camera maintains a high, top-down perspective throughout, gradually increasing altitude and revealing more of the simulated city.

## CAMERA & RECORDING SETTINGS

**Video Resolution:** 1920x1080  
**Frame Rate:** 20.0 fps  
**Recording Format:** MP4  

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**Obstacles Present:** ⬜ None ☒ Trees ☒ Buildings ⬜ Power Lines ⬜ Other: Roads, water body  
**People in Area:** ☒ None ⬜ Pilot Only ⬜ Small Group ⬜ Crowd  
**Emergency Landing Sites:** Numerous open grassy areas and large parking lots visible, especially in the earlier parts of the flight.

## INCIDENTS & OBSERVATIONS

**Any Issues Encountered:** None  
**Wildlife Interactions:** None visible  
**Signal Loss Events:** None  
**Weather Changes:** No changes observed; consistent clear, sunny conditions.  
**Equipment Malfunctions:** None  

## NOTES & LESSONS LEARNED

**Flight Performance:** Smooth and stable, consistent movement and camera control.  
**Footage Quality:** Good, clear, and well-exposed.  
**Areas for Improvement:** N/A  
**Future Considerations:** The current flight provides a good overview of different urban and suburban zones. For future safety monitoring, specific areas of interest (e.g., high-traffic intersections, public gathering spaces, critical infrastructure) could be identified for more detailed, lower-altitude inspections. The flight path demonstrates capability for broad area coverage.
