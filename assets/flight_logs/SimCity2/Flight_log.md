# DRONE FLIGHT LOG

## FLIGHT IDENTIFICATION

**Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Start Time:** 10:00  
**End Time:** 10:03  
**Total Duration:** 2 min 20 sec

## FLIGHT PURPOSE & OPERATIONS

**Purpose of Flight:** City Safety Monitoring  
**Type of Operation:** Aerial Surveillance

## LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT

**Location Name/Description:** Simulator city - urban downtown core with waterfront area (starts over undeveloped land, transitions through suburban commercial/residential, then dense urban, and ends near a coastal residential area)  
**GPS Coordinates (Takeoff):** Open land in rural area  
**GPS Coordinates (Landing):** Other place (not visible in the video)  
**Weather Conditions:**
- Wind Speed: Appears calm (no visible wind effects on trees or water)
- Wind Direction: N/A
- Visibility: Excellent, clear conditions with sharp visibility
- Temperature: Not mentioned
- Cloud Cover: Clear skies
- Precipitation: None

## FLIGHT PARAMETERS

**Maximum Altitude:** Not visible (continuously increasing, reaches high altitude over skyscrapers)  
**Maximum Distance:** Not visible (covers a significant area of the simulated city)  
**Flight Pattern:** ☑ Free Flight  
**Key Waypoints/Locations:** Undeveloped grassy land, industrial facility, commercial buildings, residential houses, downtown intersection with roundabout, rail crossing with tram lines, downtown skyscrapers including some with rooftop solar panels, waterfront area with rocky shoreline, coastal area/beach, suburban residential neighborhood  
**Flight Path Summary:** The drone begins over an open, undeveloped grassy area, then transitions over a suburban zone featuring commercial buildings and residential houses. Started over industrial area, moved through downtown core with multiple intersections and roundabouts, progressed to waterfront area with rocky shoreline and beach, ended in suburban residential zone. The camera maintains a high, top-down perspective throughout, gradually increasing altitude and revealing more of the simulated city with smooth transitions between locations.

## CAMERA & RECORDING SETTINGS

**Video Resolution:** 1920x1080  
**Frame Rate:** 20.0 fps  
**Recording Format:** MP4

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**Obstacles Present:** ☑ Trees ☑ Buildings ☑ Other: High-rise towers, tram lines, roundabouts, roads, water body  
**People in Area:** ☑ Small Group (workers with hard hats observed, two figures on rooftop) - *Note: One log reported no people visible*  
**Emergency Landing Sites:** Numerous open grassy areas, large parking lots, vacant lots, and plaza areas observed, especially in the earlier parts of the flight

## INCIDENTS & OBSERVATIONS

**Any Issues Encountered:** Initial focus problems with blurry footage that quickly transitions to clear imagery  
**Wildlife Interactions:** None observed  
**Signal Loss Events:** None mentioned  
**Weather Changes:** No changes observed; consistent clear, bright, sunny conditions throughout  
**Equipment Malfunctions:** Initial focus/stability issues resolved quickly

## NOTES & LESSONS LEARNED

**Flight Performance:** Smooth and stable flight with consistent movement, smooth transitions between locations, and excellent camera control  
**Footage Quality:** High quality after initial focus adjustment - sharp, clear imagery with excellent detail of urban infrastructure, good exposure, and well-exposed footage  
**Areas for Improvement:** Initial camera focus calibration could be improved  
**Future Considerations:** Excellent documentation of urban traffic patterns, infrastructure layout, and city planning elements for safety monitoring purposes. The current flight provides a good overview of different urban and suburban zones. For future safety monitoring, specific areas of interest (e.g., high-traffic intersections, public gathering spaces, critical infrastructure) could be identified for more detailed, lower-altitude inspections. The flight path demonstrates capability for broad area coverage.
