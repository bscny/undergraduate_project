## FLIGHT PARAMETERS

**Maximum Altitude:** Approximately 50-100 meters (estimated, based on perspective relative to trees and hills)  
**Maximum Distance:** Not mentioned  
**Flight Pattern:** ☑ Free Flight  
**Key Waypoints/Locations:** Initial scene with a tractor, police car, and people; rural road through lush landscape, bridge/culvert structure/elevated sections, cultivated fields, areas with cattle/herd of buffalo on the road  
**Flight Path Summary:** The drone begins at a lower altitude, observing a stationary tractor and police car with people gathered around. It then ascends slightly and follows the police car as it drives along a winding rural road through dense greenery, elevated sections, and agricultural areas. The drone maintains a relatively consistent altitude and follows the road through the vegetated, hilly terrain, encountering a motorcycle and later livestock.
