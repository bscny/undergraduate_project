# DRONE FLIGHT LOG

## FLIGHT IDENTIFICATION

**Date:** 2025-08-20  
**Start Time:** 10:00  
**End Time:** 10:02  
**Total Duration:** 2 min 11 sec

## FLIGHT PURPOSE & OPERATIONS

**Purpose of Flight:** capture scenic visuals from a beautiful mountain  
**Type of Operation:** Recreational Flight

## LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT

**Location Name/Description:** north Canada - breathtaking mountainous landscape with pristine wilderness valley featuring dense coniferous forest, a river/waterfall, and snow-capped peaks in the distance  
**GPS Coordinates (Takeoff):** open space in the forest  
**GPS Coordinates (Landing):** same as takeoff place  
**Weather Conditions:**
- Wind Speed: Low or no wind (inferred from still vegetation)
- Wind Direction: Not visible
- Visibility: Clear to Good - soft, diffused lighting throughout
- Temperature: Not mentioned
- Cloud Cover: Partly cloudy to overcast - soft cloud cover with gentle shadows and some clouds
- Precipitation: None observed/visible

## FLIGHT PARAMETERS

**Maximum Altitude:** Drone ascends significantly from the valley floor to reveal distant snow-capped peaks  
**Maximum Distance:** Not mentioned  
**Flight Pattern:** ☑ Free Flight  
**Key Waypoints/Locations:** Snow-capped mountain peaks, dense evergreen forest valley, winding river with waterfalls - starts over a forest near a river/waterfall, moves into a mountain valley  
**Flight Path Summary:** The drone begins relatively low over a forest, then smoothly ascends and moves forward, following a river/waterfall deeper into a mountain valley, revealing snow-capped peaks in the distance while maintaining aerial survey over mountainous valley with consistent altitude and perspective

## CAMERA & RECORDING SETTINGS

**Video Resolution:** 3840x2160  
**Frame Rate:** 29.97 fps (29.97002997002997 fps)  
**Recording Format:** mp4

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**Obstacles Present:** ☑ Trees ☑ Other: Mountain peaks, dense forest canopy, mountains, river/waterfall  
**People in Area:** ☑ None  
**Emergency Landing Sites:** open space in the forest (takeoff location) - potential open areas along the river or within the forest not clearly visible

## INCIDENTS & OBSERVATIONS

**Any Issues Encountered:** None reported/visible  
**Wildlife Interactions:** None observed/visible  
**Signal Loss Events:** None reported/visible  
**Weather Changes:** Consistent soft cloud cover with slight variations in lighting intensity - no significant changes observed during the flight  
**Equipment Malfunctions:** None reported/visible

## NOTES & LESSONS LEARNED

**Flight Performance:** Stable flight with consistent positioning over valley - smooth and stable flight  
**Footage Quality:** Excellent - captured breathtaking views with soft, diffused lighting enhancing natural beauty - high quality, clear, and well-focused  
**Areas for Improvement:** Not mentioned  
**Future Considerations:** Consider capturing different seasonal variations of this location to document ecosystem changes, explore closer proximity shots of the waterfalls and river features while maintaining safe distance from terrain, and plan flights during different lighting conditions (golden hour) to enhance the dramatic contrast between snow-capped peaks and forest canopy
