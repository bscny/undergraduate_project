**Start Time:** 10:00  
**End Time:** 10:04  
**Total Duration:** 3 min 16 sec

## FLIGHT PURPOSE & OPERATIONS

**Purpose of Flight:** fly over my private property to assess its suitability as a recreational area  
**Type of Operation:** Aerial Surveying

## LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT

**Location Name/Description:** suburban private land, featuring modern buildings, green spaces, roads, a pond, and various sports facilities (soccer field, volleyball courts, baseball field).  
**GPS Coordinates (Takeoff):** open space next to my place  
**GPS Coordinates (Landing):** same as takeoff place  
**Weather Conditions:**
- Wind Speed: Low (inferred from static trees)
- Wind Direction: Not visible
- Visibility: Very Low (due to fog/haze)
- Temperature: N/A
- Cloud Cover: Overcast/Foggy
- Precipitation: None visible

## FLIGHT PARAMETERS

**Maximum Altitude:** Not visible  
**Maximum Distance:** Not visible  
**Flight Pattern:** ⬜ Hover ⬜ Linear ⬜ Orbit ⬜ Waypoint ☒ Free Flight  
**Key Waypoints/Locations:** Multiple modern buildings, roads, a pond, a soccer field, two sand volleyball courts, and a baseball field.  
**Flight Path Summary:** The drone initiated flight at a high altitude with extremely low visibility due to fog/haze. It then descended and proceeded to traverse the suburban property, capturing top-down views. The flight path covered various sections of the property, including different architectural structures, landscaped areas, a body of water, and multiple sports facilities. The movement was continuous and sweeping, without extended periods of hovering.

## CAMERA & RECORDING SETTINGS

**Video Resolution:** 1920x1080  
**Frame Rate:** 20.0 fps  
**Recording Format:** MP4  

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**Obstacles Present:** ⬜ None ☒ Trees ☒ Buildings ⬜ Power Lines ☒ Other: Roads, Pond, Sports Fields  
**People in Area:** ☒ None ⬜ Pilot Only ⬜ Small Group ⬜ Crowd  
**Emergency Landing Sites:** Open grassy areas and sports fields are available.  

## INCIDENTS & OBSERVATIONS

**Any Issues Encountered:** Very low visibility due to persistent fog/haze significantly hampered visual assessment.  
**Wildlife Interactions:** None visible  
**Signal Loss Events:** None visible  
**Weather Changes:** Weather conditions remained consistently foggy/hazy throughout the flight.  
**Equipment Malfunctions:** None  

## NOTES & LESSONS LEARNED

**Flight Performance:** The drone maintained a smooth and stable flight path, but the overall effectiveness of the survey was compromised by the poor visibility.  
**Footage Quality:** The video resolution is clear, but the visual clarity of the environment is poor due to the dense fog/haze.  
**Areas for Improvement:** Future flights for property assessment should be scheduled during clearer weather conditions to ensure optimal visibility and detailed observation.  
**Future Considerations:** A follow-up flight is necessary in clear weather to accurately assess the property's features and its suitability as a recreational area, as the current footage does not provide sufficient detail for a comprehensive evaluation due to the limited visibility.
