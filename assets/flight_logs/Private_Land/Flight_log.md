# DRONE FLIGHT LOG

## FLIGHT IDENTIFICATION

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Start Time:** 10:00  
**End Time:** 10:04  
**Total Duration:** 3 min 16 sec

## FLIGHT PURPOSE & OPERATIONS

**Purpose of Flight:** fly over my private property to assess its suitability as a recreational area  
**Type of Operation:** Aerial Surveying

## LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT

**Location Name/Description:** suburban private land, featuring modern buildings with flat roofs, green spaces, tree-lined roadways, a pond, and various sports facilities (soccer field/soccer pitch, sand volleyball courts, tennis courts, and baseball field)  
**GPS Coordinates (Takeoff):** open space next to my place  
**GPS Coordinates (Landing):** same as takeoff place  
**Weather Conditions:**
- Wind Speed: Low (inferred from static trees)
- Wind Direction: Not visible
- Visibility: Heavy fog/low cloud cover with very limited visibility throughout flight
- Temperature: Cool conditions
- Cloud Cover: Dense fog/overcast throughout flight
- Precipitation: Damp conditions, surfaces appear wet

## FLIGHT PARAMETERS

**Maximum Altitude:** Not mentioned/not visible due to fog conditions  
**Maximum Distance:** Not mentioned/not visible due to fog conditions  
**Flight Pattern:** ☑ Free Flight  
**Key Waypoints/Locations:** Modern buildings with flat roofs, athletic fields (soccer pitch/soccer field, sand volleyball courts, tennis courts, baseball field), tree-lined roadways, landscaped lawns, pond, well-maintained walking paths  
**Flight Path Summary:** The drone initiated flight at a high altitude with extremely low visibility due to fog/haze, then descended and proceeded to traverse the suburban property in a continuous and sweeping survey pattern. The flight path covered various sections of the property without extended periods of hovering, revealing sports complex facilities, modern buildings, landscaped grounds, and a body of water.

## CAMERA & RECORDING SETTINGS

**Video Resolution:** 1920x1080  
**Frame Rate:** 20.0 fps  
**Recording Format:** MP4

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**Obstacles Present:** ☑ Trees ☑ Buildings ☑ Other: Stadium light poles, utility poles, roads, pond, sports fields  
**People in Area:** ☑ None  
**Emergency Landing Sites:** Open lawns, grassy areas throughout property, and sports fields are available

## INCIDENTS & OBSERVATIONS

**Any Issues Encountered:** Initial flight through dense fog/cloud layer with very limited visibility that persisted throughout the entire flight, significantly hampering visual assessment  
**Wildlife Interactions:** None visible  
**Signal Loss Events:** None visible/not mentioned  
**Weather Changes:** Flight began in thick fog with visibility remaining consistently limited and foggy/hazy conditions throughout the entire duration  
**Equipment Malfunctions:** None

## NOTES & LESSONS LEARNED

**Flight Performance:** Drone successfully navigated through challenging foggy conditions and maintained a smooth and stable flight path, but the overall effectiveness of the survey was compromised by the poor visibility  
**Footage Quality:** The video resolution is clear and initially obscured by fog, then revealed some architectural and landscape details, but the visual clarity of the environment remained poor due to the dense fog/haze  
**Areas for Improvement:** Consider waiting for better weather conditions for clearer documentation. Future flights for property assessment should be scheduled during clearer weather conditions to ensure optimal visibility and detailed observation  
**Future Considerations:** Property appears well-suited for recreational use with existing sports facilities including soccer field, volleyball courts, tennis courts, baseball field, and well-maintained walking paths. However, a follow-up flight is necessary in clear weather to accurately assess the property's features and its suitability as a recreational area, as the current footage does not provide sufficient detail for a comprehensive evaluation due to the limited visibility conditions.
