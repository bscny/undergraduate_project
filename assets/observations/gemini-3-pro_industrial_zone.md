# DRONE FLIGHT LOG

## FLIGHT IDENTIFICATION

**Date:** 2025-11-19  
**Start Time:** 10:00  
**End Time:** 10:03  
**Total Duration:** 00:01:02

## FLIGHT PURPOSE & OPERATIONS

**Purpose of Flight:** assessing the extent and layout of solar panel installations  
**Type of Operation:** Industrial Survey Flight

## LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT

**Location Name/Description:** America, rural industry area  
**GPS Coordinates (Takeoff):** open space next to the zone  
**GPS Coordinates (Landing):** Same as takeoff place  
**Weather Conditions:**
- Wind Speed: N/A
- Wind Direction: N/A
- Visibility: High (Clear)
- Temperature: N/A
- Cloud Cover: Clear/Sunny (indicated by distinct, long shadows)
- Precipitation: None

## FLIGHT PARAMETERS

**Maximum Altitude:** N/A  
**Maximum Distance:** N/A  
**Flight Pattern:** ⬜ Hover ☑ Linear ⬜ Orbit ⬜ Waypoint ⬜ Free Flight  
**Key Waypoints/Locations:** Large green/orange warehouse, railway tracks, long curved warehouse with rooftop solar array.  
**Flight Path Summary:** The drone travels forward in a linear path over an industrial complex. It begins overlooking a loading dock area and tracks parallel to a railway line, following the length of a long, curved warehouse roof to reveal a strip of solar panels installed on the structure.

## CAMERA & RECORDING SETTINGS

**Video Resolution:** 3840x2160  
**Frame Rate:** 59.94005994005994 fps  
**Recording Format:** MP4  

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**Obstacles Present:** ⬜ None ⬜ Trees ☑ Buildings ☑ Power Lines ⬜ Other: Railway infrastructure  
**People in Area:** ⬜ None ⬜ Pilot Only ⬜ Small Group ⬜ Crowd (Note: People not clearly visible due to altitude, but parked and moving vehicles indicate active site)  
**Emergency Landing Sites:** Flat rooftops of adjacent warehouses or paved parking lots (though cluttered with vehicles).  

## INCIDENTS & OBSERVATIONS

**Any Issues Encountered:** None observed.  
**Wildlife Interactions:** None observed.  
**Signal Loss Events:** None observed.  
**Weather Changes:** Constant clear conditions throughout the flight.  
**Equipment Malfunctions:** None observed.  

## NOTES & LESSONS LEARNED

**Flight Performance:** Flight was stable and smooth with consistent speed, allowing for a steady survey of the rooftops.  
**Footage Quality:** Excellent lighting and clarity; the low sun angle created long shadows but did not obscure the target solar installations on the roof.  
**Areas for Improvement:** N/A  
**Future Considerations:** To better assess the solar panel installations, future flights should include a top-down (nadir) camera angle or thermal imaging to inspect for individual panel defects or heat spots, rather than just the oblique angle used for layout assessment.
