**Total Duration:** 2 min 20 sec

## FLIGHT PURPOSE & OPERATIONS

**Purpose of Flight:** City Safety Monitoring  
**Type of Operation:** Aerial Surveillance

## LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT

**Location Name/Description:** Simulator city (Urban environment transitioning from industrial to high-rise downtown, coastal, and residential zones)  
**GPS Coordinates (Takeoff):** Open land in rural area  
**GPS Coordinates (Landing):** Other place (not visible in the video)  
**Weather Conditions:**
- Wind Speed: N/A (Visuals suggest calm conditions)
- Wind Direction: N/A

## FLIGHT PARAMETERS

**Maximum Altitude:** N/A (Visual estimate: Clearance above high-rise structures)  
**Maximum Distance:** N/A  
**Flight Pattern:** ⬜ Hover ☑ Linear ⬜ Orbit ⬜ Waypoint ⬜ Free Flight  
**Key Waypoints/Locations:** Industrial park, Downtown intersection, Roundabout, Coastline/Beach, Residential neighborhood  
**Flight Path Summary:** Continuous straight-line flight path (nadir view) beginning over outskirts/industrial lots, crossing directly over the city center high-rises and a major roundabout, traversing the coastline, and terminating over a suburban residential grid.

## CAMERA & RECORDING SETTINGS

**Video Resolution:** 1920x1080  
**Frame Rate:** 20.0 fps  
**Recording Format:** MP4  

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**Obstacles Present:** ⬜ None ☑ Trees ☑ Buildings ⬜ Power Lines ⬜ Other: _______________  
**People in Area:** ⬜ None ⬜ Pilot Only ⬜ Small Group ⬜ Crowd (Note: Vehicle traffic is heavy; individual pedestrians not clearly distinguishable)  
**Emergency Landing Sites:** Large parking lots in the industrial zone, the beach area, and open grassy plots in the residential zone.  

## INCIDENTS & OBSERVATIONS

**Any Issues Encountered:** None observed.  
**Wildlife Interactions:** None observed.  
**Signal Loss Events:** None.  
**Weather Changes:** None; lighting remained consistent.  
**Equipment Malfunctions:** None.  

## NOTES & LESSONS LEARNED

**Flight Performance:** Flight was stable with a consistent velocity and altitude maintenance throughout the transition between low-rise and high-rise zones.  
**Footage Quality:** Clear visibility of road networks and building layouts; lighting conditions were optimal for surveillance.  
**Areas for Improvement:** N/A  
**Future Considerations:** For effective City Safety Monitoring, future flights should ensure altitude is adjusted to maintain consistent ground sampling distance (GSD) when transitioning between high-rise downtown areas and lower residential zones to ensure license plates or specific safety hazards remain identifiable.
